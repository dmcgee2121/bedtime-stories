      <h2>🦸‍♂️ Super Jackson</h2>
<p><strong>Save's Dad Part 1</strong></p>
      <p>Once upon a time, in a quiet little house, lived the world’s greatest hero… Super Jackson!
He wasn’t just any kid—he had the biggest smile, the fastest feet, and the bravest heart.

But most importantly… he had a dad who always found himself in the silliest situations. Everyone called him Silly Dad.</p>
<p>One sunny morning, Super Jackson was putting on his sneakers when he heard a loud cry:
“Jackson! Oh no! Help!”

Super Jackson raced to the living room. There stood Silly Dad, hopping around on one foot.
“What’s wrong, Dad?” Jackson asked, hands on his hips like a real hero.

“I can’t find my other shoe!” Dad said. “I just had it, and now it’s gone! How will I go outside with only ONE shoe?”
<br/>
<br/>
Super Jackson looked around. He checked under the couch.
He checked behind the door.
He even peeked inside the refrigerator—just in case!

But the shoe was nowhere to be seen.

“Hmm,” Super Jackson said. “This looks like… a mystery!”</p>

<p>Just then, he spotted something strange: a trail of tiny muddy footprints leading down the hallway.

“Follow me, Dad!” Jackson shouted.
The two of them tiptoed down the hall until they reached the laundry basket.

And there it was—Dad’s missing shoe, stuck in with all the socks!

Dad scratched his head. “How did my shoe get in there?”

Super Jackson laughed. “Because you’re Silly Dad! You probably kicked it off by accident!”</p>

<p>Dad slipped on his shoe and smiled.
“Super Jackson, you saved the day! I couldn’t have done it without you.”

Super Jackson puffed out his chest proudly. “That’s what heroes do.”</p>

<p>And do you know how heroes celebrate after saving the day?
They eat their favorite food together!

That night, Super Jackson and Silly Dad sat at the table with two big cheesy slices of pizza.
They laughed, they munched, and they agreed:
“No one saves the day quite like Super Jackson!”</p><br/>
