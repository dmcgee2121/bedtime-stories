      <h2>🚀 Super Jackson Builds a Rocket</h2>
      <p>Part 2: Mission to the Moon</p>

      <p>One cloudy afternoon, Super Jackson was bored. No mysteries to solve. No shoes to find. Just a quiet house and a very silly dad.</p>

      <p>“Dad,” Jackson said, “I want to go on an adventure. A BIG one!”</p>

      <p>Dad grinned. “How big are we talking? Like… backyard big? Or outer space big?”</p>

      <p>Jackson’s eyes lit up. “Outer space! Let’s build a rocket!”</p>

      <p>So they gathered supplies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One giant cardboard box</li>
        <li>Two paper towel tubes (for boosters!)</li>
        <li>Lots of shiny foil</li>
        <li>And stickers. SO many stickers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>They taped and wrapped and decorated until the rocket was ready. It had buttons made from bottle caps and a steering wheel made from a frisbee.</p>

      <p>“Ready for launch?” Dad asked.</p>

      <p>Jackson climbed inside. “Ready, Captain Silly!”</p>

      <p>“3… 2… 1… BLAST OFF!”</p>

      <p>The rocket shook (because Dad was pushing it), and zoomed through the living room, past the couch nebula and the lamp asteroid belt.</p>

      <p>“We’re approaching the moon!” Jackson shouted.</p>

      <p>They landed with a soft thud (on a pillow). Jackson stepped out and planted a flag made from a sock and a chopstick.</p>

      <p>“We did it!” he said. “We’re the first pizza-loving astronauts on the moon!”</p>

      <p>Dad handed him a slice. “Space explorers need snacks.”</p>

      <p>They munched, they giggled, and they looked up at the stars painted on the ceiling.</p>

      <p>“Next time,” Jackson said, “we should visit Mars.”</p>

      <p>Dad nodded. “But only if they have pepperoni.”</p>

      <p>And with that, Super Jackson’s rocket adventure came to a cheesy, giggly end.</p>

      <p>The End (until next mission).</p>
